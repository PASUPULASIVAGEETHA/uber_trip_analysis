# Uber Trip Analysis
# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover patterns in travel demand, vehicle activity, and dispatching efficiency. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to extract actionable insights that can help improve decision-making in ride-sharing operations.

# 📊 Dataset

Dataset: Uber Jan–Feb FOIL dataset

Key Columns:

Date → Trip date

Dispatching_base_number → Uber base code

Active_vehicles → Number of active vehicles per day

Trips → Number of trips completed

# 🔑 Process

Data Collection – Imported dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning – Removed missing values, corrected datatypes, and standardized date formats.

Feature Engineering – Extracted Day, Month, Week, and Day of Week from Date.

EDA & Visualization – Created charts and heatmaps to explore trends.

Insights – Derived business-oriented findings from the data.

# 📈 Key Insights

Weekdays show higher trip demand compared to weekends.

Certain dispatch bases handled the majority of trips.

Active vehicles strongly influence the number of completed trips.

Weekly demand patterns highlight predictable fluctuations useful for planning.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
